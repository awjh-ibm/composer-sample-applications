                <p>In this sample you will take on the role of four participants to see how blockchain can be used to track letters of credit. These participants are:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Alice Hamilton</strong> - Owner of QuickFix IT, a company specialising in the sale of computers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Bob Appleton</strong> - Owner of Conga Computers, a manufacturer of computers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Matías</strong> - Employee of Penguin Bank, the bank which Alice has an account with.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ella</strong> - Employee of the Bank of Hursley, the bank which Bob has an account with.</p>
                
                <p>The above participants have varying roles in the scenario with Alice playing the <em>applicant</em>, Bob the <em>beneficiary</em>, Matías the <em>issuing bank</em> and Ella the <em>exporter bank</em>.</p>
                
                <p>In the scenario that this sample covers Alice and Bob have agreed that Alice will purchase computers from Bob's next shipment and have agreed a price for these. Alice unfortunately does not have enough money in her account to cover the entire cost of the purchase and therefore she is requesting a letter of credit to cover this cost from her Bank, Penguin Bank. This sample will cover how this letter of credit is tracked using blockchain.</p>
